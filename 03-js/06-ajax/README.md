# Ajax
- _AJAX_ - Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
- Why Ajax? - for making HTTP (protocol) requests (header (key-value pairs, eg. 'Content-Type' : 'text/html'), body - has the data)
- How is the data formatted (content type)
    - understood and editable by us and machines (any language)
        - XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
        - JSON 
            - JavaScript Object Notation
            - number, boolean, string, plain JS object, array, null
            - Usually the top level has an object / array
            - string should be double quoted
        - We usually work with JSON - in general it is lighter than XML, and it is closer to JS object syntax
