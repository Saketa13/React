# What are the advantages of React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, Ember, Knockout
- Component-based - allow you to build small pices of the UI and compose them together
    - reuse smaller pieces in many places
        - customized via some props (attributes)
    - helps a team work on independent pieces of the application UI
    - most of the common UI concerns like event handling, DOM manipulation are taken care by the library/framework
    - allow you to tie data to the UI
        - you are only concerned about the data, and the library/framework takes care of manipulating the DOM to reflect the data
        - when data changes, the UI updates automatically (data-binding is a popular name for this concept)
    - Angular also takes of data fetching, routing (change the page when URL changes in a SPA). React leaves these concerns to the developer's preferences
        - You have to use other libraries when working with React
- Business cases
    - You have a team of good JS developers - you can use React. Angular is good for people who usually do not work with JS.
    - Performance-wise Angular and React are similar
- React is a "library" -> only concerned with building UI
- Angular is a "framework" -> there is a set architecture for the app, you need to structure files and folders in a certain way, and it addresses most of app development concerns
